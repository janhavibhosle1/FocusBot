| ITEM | SCORE | FEEDBACK |

| <tr><th colspan=3> Setup </th></tr> |
| **Problem Stmt** | 7.5/15 | The problem is not clear defined:  Is it context-switching?   Tracking many tasks?  Or prioritizing tasks?  Also unclear "Each team member needs to be updated his/her tasks at regular intervals of time to ensure successful completion."?      "Why need an assistant when all these tasks can be done by a BOT."  Belong in the "bot Description", not the problem |
| **Bot Description** | 5.0/10 | "Based on statistics, there is an average of 23 minutes in productivity loss because of context switching."  Citation or source?<br><br>"it will send reminders"  <-- When?  What problem does this solve -- productivity?  Won't users have to switch contexts to read reminder messages?<br><br>"the bot will also be able to coordinate between team members so as to track team tasks and deadlines."  This is a different problem -- team coordination which was not described in the prob statement. |
| **Use Cases** | 12.5/15 | NOTE THIS IS FEEDBACK YOU PREVIOUSLY RECEIVED<br /><br />You have a start on your Use Cases, but they need Revisions:    Is the priority a number?   High-medium-low?  you'll need these details in your use cases.<br><br>UC2: "E1  If two tasks have the same priority, the tasks should be completed in the order in which they were assigned."  This is not the error response, this is the situtation that describes when an error occurs -- the Error Flows should describe the response.<br><br> |
| **Wireframes** | 14.0/15 | These wireframes show what might be missing -- the "task1" "task2" names don't convey enough information about the tasks to demonstrate what the value of this information might be.   Maybe there needs to be a description too? |
| **Storyboard** | 15.0/15 | This is pretty good use of a storyboard. |
| **Architecture + Additional Patterns** | 15.0/30 | The problem description says the tasks are dependent on one another but this is not reflected in the architecture.   Also, where is the bot?  the database appears to be in the cloud?  <br><br>The additional patterns section introduces a new concept, Mattermost boards, which is not mentioned in the rest of the proposal or connected to the wireframes or storyboards.<br>Also, "Additional Patterns" should be connected design patterns as talked about in lecture. |
