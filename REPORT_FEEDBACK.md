| ITEM | SCORE | FEEDBACK |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **PRESENTATION** | 17.5/25 | I’m not sure this format helps the audience understand what’s going on — the music and stock footage is more of a distraction.   Looping the audio in the use cases made it seem repetitive.  |
| **PEER PRESENTATION EVALUATIONS** | 10.0/10 | (If you did 4 or more, your bonus will be on your individual moodle grade.) |
| **REPORT** | 15.0/15 |  |
| **360 PEER EVALUATION** | 50.0/50 | (If your moodle score is significantly lower than your team score, you might not have submitted a 360 peer evaluation.) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Total** | 92.5/100 |  |
